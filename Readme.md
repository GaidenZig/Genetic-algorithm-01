# Genetic algorithm experimentation
This is a program that reach characters to fit a string (can be a frase or a word, but without special characters), using genetic algorithm
to populate a pull with a lot of individues representing a possible string equals to the goal, so... yeah a lot of childrens die generation after generation... RIP.

Writen only for studing purposes based on "The Nature of Code" series by Daniel Shiffman, go to check his amazing work (O-O)! https://natureofcode.com/

I adapted the code to fit a javascript application for modern browsers, and this app specifically is my adaptation of the episode 9.3 "Shakespeare Monkey Example" from the youtube series, so thank you very much Daniel for spread your holy knowledge to us simple mortals.
